# Offset-discovery ledger

Last updated: 2026-08-02 (OD-RECOVERY-005)

This ledger is the durable index of WoT Blitz PC offset-discovery work. It
records experiments, partial results, failures, and pivots so future sessions do
not repeat an exhausted approach without a changed hypothesis.

It is separate from `memory-offsets/<version>.json`: the versioned table is a
small publication surface, while this ledger retains the reasoning and the
negative evidence behind candidates. Raw memory dumps, CE tables, pointer maps,
screenshots, player data, private replay paths, and game-derived files stay
outside tracked source.

## Status vocabulary

### Experiment status

- `Planned` — defined but not started.
- `Running` — active; must be closed by the next handoff.
- `Partial` — produced useful intermediate evidence but not a reproducible
  candidate.
- `CandidateFound` — produced a candidate with a clear address kind and an
  explicit next verification step.
- `NoSignal` — the chosen hypothesis produced no usable signal.
- `Ambiguous` — multiple interpretations or candidates remain.
- `Blocked` — a prerequisite prevented a valid experiment.
- `Superseded` — later evidence invalidated the result.
- `Verified` — only after the offset-table schema and runtime evidence gate pass.

### Address-kind vocabulary

Every address must be classified before publication:

- `absolute` — valid for one process instance only;
- `module-rva` — relative to a named module base;
- `member-displacement` — an instruction/object offset such as `[reg+0x34]`;
- `pointer-chain` — a stable module root followed by pointer displacements;
- `heap-dynamic` — a process-specific allocation with no stable root yet;
- `unknown` — not enough information to classify safely.

## Current decision register

| Item | Current decision |
|------|------------------|
| Campaign version | `11.19.0.10` |
| Executable identity | Hash recorded in `memory-offsets/11.19.0.10.json`; re-measure before a live session |
| Runtime-supported fields | None; current table has 0 usable offsets, 1 Stale/quarantined field, and 7 Unknown |
| `playerYaw` | **Quarantined / Ambiguous** until decimal, hexadecimal, raw Ghidra, and address-kind evidence reconcile |
| Trusted next anchor | `playerPositionX`/`playerPositionZ`, then `replayTime` or HP if the replay makes them observable |
| Do not repeat | The same yaw neighborhood scan using `0x0317A810` without resolving its provenance |
| Next planned session | `OD-RECOVERY-006` (pointer-chain / structural root for the private-mapping survivor set from OD-RECOVERY-005; second distinct replay still required before promotion) |

The current yaw conflict is recorded explicitly:

| Representation | Value |
|----------------|-------:|
| Prior offset-table decimal | `51808784` |
| Conversion of prior table decimal | `0x03168A10` |
| Prior offset-table notes | `0x0317A810` (`51882000`) |
| Current published value | `0` with `Stale` status; prior evidence retained in notes |
| Raw Ghidra export top candidate | `56085200` (`0x0357CAD0`) |

These are not interchangeable. No one of them is authoritative until the raw
analysis and address kind are reconciled.

## Historical experiment index

These entries summarize durable repository evidence. They distinguish tool and
pipeline work from a successful live-game discovery; the latter has not yet
occurred.

| Session ID | Date | Objective | Tools | Result | What it established | What it did not establish |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|--------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| `OD-2026-07-30-GHIDRA-001` | 2026-07-30 | Produce static candidate hypotheses from `wotblitz.exe` | Ghidra `FindOffsets.java` / export | `Partial` | `playerYaw` had string/xref/data-reference activity; HP was noisy; most other fields had no useful xrefs | No field layout, module-RVA proof, dynamic behavior, or verified offset |
| `OD-2026-07-30-SCANNER-001` | 2026-07-30 | Build guarded snapshot/compare/neighborhood discovery | GameIntegration scanner + GameHarness | `Partial` | Gate-checked discovery surfaces and cancellation/identity boundaries exist | No live candidate was verified; API readability is not field evidence |
| `OD-2026-07-30-CE-TOOLING-001` | 2026-07-30 | Create operator-led CE neighborhood and multiscan paths | Cheat Engine Lua scripts | `Partial` | CE output formats and manual/auto scan procedures are represented | No trustworthy live CE result is recorded in the repository |
| `OD-2026-07-31-EVIDENCE-PIPELINE-001` | 2026-07-31 | Normalize CE output and publish conservatively | `discover-offsets.ps1`, report script, schema validator | `CandidateFound` for tooling only | Unique candidates can be normalized; conflicts remain report-only; publication never promotes | It did not discover or verify a game field |
| `OD-2026-07-31-HASH-001` | 2026-07-31 | Bind evidence to the installed executable | executable fingerprint + offset table | `Partial` | Exact SHA-256 metadata is recorded for version `11.19.0.10` | Hash identity does not prove an offset's correctness |
| `OD-2026-07-31-DOC-001` | 2026-07-31 | Refresh live documentation and handoffs | docs, offline checks, tests | `CandidateFound` for documentation only | Current commands, safety gates, and promotion rules are documented | It did not add dynamic offset evidence |
| `OD-2026-07-31-YAW-RECONCILE-001` | 2026-07-31 | Reconcile the published `playerYaw` candidate | table, raw Ghidra export, arithmetic checks | `Ambiguous` | The decimal/hex/table/export conflict is proven and must be resolved | No safe yaw anchor exists; do not repeat its neighborhood scan |
| `OD-RECOVERY-001` | next session | Establish one clean dynamic anchor | CE first; GameHarness/x64dbg as follow-up | `Planned` | See the protocol below; superseded by `OD-RECOVERY-001-BLOCKED` for the attempted gate check | Must not begin until identity and offline gates pass |
| `OD-RECOVERY-001-BLOCKED` | 2026-07-31 | Execute the Phase 0 gate for `OD-RECOVERY-001` | host state + GameHarness probe | `Blocked` | Multiple game processes were present and the host reported `Unknown` / `launch.awaiting_evidence`; no scan was started | No PID was admissible for discovery; do not attach to the vanilla or smoke-test processes |
| `OD-RECOVERY-002` | 2026-07-31 | Establish one managed replay after the prior gate block | managed launch, host state, read-only process inventory | `Superseded` | The planned launch protocol was attempted and produced a blocked result before scanning | Superseded by `OD-RECOVERY-002-BLOCKED`; do not treat it as a discovery result |
| `OD-RECOVERY-002-BLOCKED` | 2026-07-31 | Establish one managed replay after the prior gate block | managed launch, host state, read-only process inventory | `Blocked` | Replay staging completed, but the launch timed out without correlated lifecycle evidence; host remained `Unknown` / `launch.awaiting_evidence` | No existing process is admissible; do not repeat the launch until the timeout/correlation path is diagnosed |
| `OD-RECOVERY-003` | 2026-08-02 | Prove a repeatable privacy-safe aggregate campaign; test whether a bounded main-module Float32 range is a useful natural-change anchor | two managed launches + rolling comparisons | `Partial` | Two fresh launches each reached `OfflineReplayVerified` with an exact singleton process and zero post-trial game/host processes; the aggregate-only campaign is repeatable | No single candidate survived; replay independence not proven (1 distinct payload used) |
| `OD-RECOVERY-003-BOUNDED` | 2026-08-02 | Determine whether a bounded 0–64 MiB low-address Float32 window contains eligible retained values under the privacy-safe budget ceiling | loopback `discover-snapshot` (bounded window) | `NoSignal` | Zero retained/current/changed aggregates; scanner session discarded; recorded as bounded negative setup evidence for OD-RECOVERY-004 | It did not test a populated slice; the interrupted populated-slice attempt is not scan evidence |
| `OD-RECOVERY-004` | 2026-08-02 | Controlled movement A→B Float32 narrowing for `playerPositionX`/`playerPositionZ` under a privacy-safe bounded window | managed launch + loopback snapshot/compare (`valueKind=Float`) | `Partial` | Managed Host.Web child reached `OfflineReplayVerified`; state A≈1.23M in-range floats; state B `changed≈26k` / `current≈26k` / `unchanged≈793k`; session discarded | No single address classified; promotion still blocked (BLK-0019); unbounded `--max-bytes` still hard-fails |
| `OD-RECOVERY-005` | 2026-08-02 | Reproduce A→B Float32 narrowing and classify survivor address kind | managed launch + owner-authorized foreground Watch Offline / pause-resume + loopback Float snapshot/compare | `Partial` | Host.Web child verified; A≈757k → B changed≈905 (unchanged≈756k); returned sample 100/100 `private-mapping` → treat set as `heap-dynamic` pending root; session discarded | No single reproducible candidate; no module-rva/member/pointer-chain root; second replay still required (BLK-0019) |

`OD-RECOVERY-001-BLOCKED` is the append-only superseding record for the planned
`OD-RECOVERY-001` row above. It does not represent a failed position scan.

## Historical `OD-RECOVERY-002` protocol (superseded)

This protocol is retained as append-only history. It is superseded by the
`OD-RECOVERY-002-BLOCKED` result below and the current `OD-RECOVERY-003`
protocol in `offset-discovery-workflow.md`.

Timebox: 105 minutes plus a short handoff.

### 0–10 minutes: identity and safety

- Confirm `OfflineReplayVerified`.
- Record exact executable hash, process identity, architecture, module name/base/size.
- Confirm the replay is actively playing and identify one controlled transition.
- If any identity item is missing, end as `Blocked`.

### 10–30 minutes: yaw reconciliation only

- Compare the raw Ghidra export with the offset table.
- Mechanically recalculate every decimal/hex pair.
- Determine whether each value is a module-RVA, data address, or member
  displacement.
- If no authoritative yaw interpretation is found within 20 minutes, mark yaw
  `Superseded` for this campaign and stop spending time on it.

### 30–75 minutes: one controlled position anchor

- Use `playerPositionX` or `playerPositionZ` with a known movement transition.
- Capture candidate counts after each transition.
- Repeat a transition once to distinguish tank movement from camera/UI movement.
- Stop after two filters with no meaningful information gain.

### 75–105 minutes: structural follow-up

- Trace writes/accesses for the best three candidates.
- Classify each address kind.
- Inspect neighboring fields only when the same object/register base is proven.
- Do not publish a heap-dynamic address as a module offset.

End the session with a status, even if it is `NoSignal` or `Blocked`. The next
session should begin from the recorded pivot, not from the top of this protocol.

  whatWorked:
    - Replay artifact staging completed before the timeout.
    - Read-only PID checks confirmed four currently running game processes without attaching or scanning.
    - Host remained reachable and continued to fail closed.
  whatFailed:
    - Managed launch did not produce correlated lifecycle evidence within the request timeout.
    - The current process set cannot be attributed to that launch attempt.
  rulesOut:
    - No dynamic field value, candidate address, offset, or address-kind evidence was produced.
    - Existing game processes must not be reused as the managed replay target.
  partials:
    - Staging and executable identity are prerequisites worth preserving, but neither proves a running replay.

`OD-RECOVERY-002-BLOCKED` is an append-only blocked result. It does not represent
a failed position scan and must not change `memory-offsets/11.19.0.10.json`.
Do not attempt another managed launch, attach to an existing process, or terminate
one until the launch timeout and lifecycle-correlation path have been diagnosed.

result:
  whatWorked:
    - Both fresh managed launches reached the positive offline gate with exactly one attributable game process.
    - Aggregate counts repeated exactly across launches; no candidate address, value, or scanner session identifier was rendered.
    - Rolling comparison narrowed the changed set to zero and explicit discard removed each retained scanner session.
    - Evidence expiry terminated both exact managed game processes; only the lead-started web host required explicit cleanup.
  whatFailed:
    - An initial setup rehearsal polled the gate for only four seconds and stopped before the documented lifecycle window; no scanner command ran.
    - The first verified campaign attempt exposed BLK-0020 and failed before snapshot creation; the probe was corrected and retested before these evidence trials.
    - The bounded main-module range produced no changing candidates under natural replay progression.
  rulesOut:
    - No dynamic evidence supports playerPositionX, playerPositionZ, replayTime, HP, or any other field.
    - No candidate address, RVA, member displacement, pointer chain, heap route, or address-kind classification was produced.
    - This 16 MiB main-module slice is not a useful natural-change anchor under the recorded timing and filter protocol.
    - The result cannot satisfy replay independence or offset promotion; BLK-0019 remains open.
  partials:
    - The negative aggregate result is repeatable across two independent process launches of the same replay.
    - The new command proves bounded orchestration, output redaction, rolling reduction, and scanner-session cleanup against the real guarded scanner.
  nextPivot: OD-RECOVERY-004 — use a controlled movement transition to search private/heap state for playerPositionX or playerPositionZ, then classify any surviving address structurally; obtain a second distinct replay before promotion review.

`OD-RECOVERY-003` is aggregate negative evidence only. It does not make any
field `Candidate` or `Verified`, and it must not change
`memory-offsets/11.19.0.10.json`. Do not repeat the same main-module natural
change protocol without a changed scope or controlled transition.

result:
  whatWorked:
    - The bounded low-address window completed and was discarded without exposing addresses, values, or session identifiers.
    - It confirmed that an empty low-address slice yields no eligible retained values.
  whatFailed:
    - An unbounded readable private/mapped snapshot exceeded the 512 MiB retained-data ceiling, so no aggregate could be produced.
    - A follow-up attempt to select a populated private/mapped slice internally was interrupted.
  rulesOut:
    - No dynamic evidence supports any field; no candidate address, RVA, or address kind was produced.
  partials:
    - The negative bounded result is reusable setup evidence for OD-RECOVERY-004.
    - A privacy-safe scanner-side bounded region budget is required before another live trial; the interrupted attempt must not be cited as a result.

`OD-RECOVERY-003-BOUNDED` is bounded negative setup evidence only. It does not
make any field `Candidate` or `Verified` and must not change
`memory-offsets/11.19.0.10.json`. The interrupted populated-slice selection

    - Explicit valueKind=Float produced a populated in-range A set (~1.23M).
    - A→B changed compare narrowed to ~26k survivors with ~793k unchanged.
  whatFailed:
    - GameHarness discover-snapshot omitted valueKind and defaulted to Int32, ignoring --float-min/--float-max (API path required).
    - Unbounded MaxBytes still hard-fails with discover.snapshot.size_limit rather than completing a truncated budgeted snapshot.
    - No single survivor was structurally classified (address kind unknown).
  rulesOut:
    - Treating a WGC-parented process as the managed research child.
    - Using discover-snapshot float bounds without sending valueKind=Float.
  partials:
    - A→B Float32 narrowing under a bounded window is reusable setup for OD-RECOVERY-005 classification.
    - OD-RECOVERY-003-BOUNDED NoSignal may have been contaminated by the Int32 CLI default; do not treat that empty low window as definitive against Float scans.

decision: changed survivors in the returned sample are private-mapping (heap-dynamic pending root); next is pointer-chain / structural root work
objective: Reproduce OD-RECOVERY-004 A→B Float32 narrowing and classify survivor address kind for playerPositionX/playerPositionZ
stopCondition: Stop after one A→B changed compare with aggregate counters and address-kind histogram only, or gate loss
method:
  primaryTool: loopback discover/snapshot + discover/compare with valueKind=Float
  valueKind: Float32
  floatBounds: [-500, 500]
  addressScope: privacy-safe bounded 64 MiB window (absolute bases local-only; not committed)
  maxBytes: 64 MiB per window
  transition: owner-authorized foreground window ops — click Watch Offline region; Space pause (A); Space resume ~2.5s; Space pause (B)
  note: guarded GameHarness input adapter remains unregistered; direct foreground ops used only under explicit owner authorization for this session

result:
  whatWorked:
    - Host.Web-managed child reached OfflineReplayVerified after owner-authorized Watch Offline click.
    - Controlled pause→brief resume→pause produced a much tighter changed set (~905) than OD-RECOVERY-004 (~26k).
    - All 100 returned candidates reported addressKind=private-mapping; classify the survivor set as heap-dynamic until a stable root exists.
  whatFailed:
    - No single candidate was isolated; compare truncated at maxCandidates=100.
    - No module-rva, member-displacement, or pointer-chain root was established.
    - Unbounded MaxBytes still hard-fails (bounded window still required).
  rulesOut:
    - Treating the OD-005 changed set as module-image / main-module natural-change survivors (sample was 100% private-mapping).
  partials:
    - Survivor-set address kind is private-mapping / heap-dynamic pending root — reusable for OD-RECOVERY-006.
    - A→B narrowing reproduced under explicit owner-authorized foreground control.
  nextPivot: OD-RECOVERY-006 — find a stable root or pointer-chain into the private-mapping survivor set; keep aggregates-only in repo; obtain a second distinct replay before promotion (BLK-0019).

```

`OD-RECOVERY-005` is aggregate classification evidence only. It does not make any
field `Candidate` or `Verified` and must not change
`memory-offsets/11.19.0.10.json`. Absolute addresses, values, and scanner
session identifiers were discarded and were not committed.

## Evidence promotion checklist

A field is ready for promotion review only when all are true:

- exact executable identity matches;
- decimal and hexadecimal forms agree;
- address kind is known;
- field type and behavior match the intended field;
- candidate survives two independent process launches;
- candidate survives two independent replays;
- static-analysis provenance is present where applicable;
- GameHarness provenance is present;
- harness invariants pass;
- lead and decoder-auditor approvals are recorded;
- no unresolved conflicting candidate remains;
- `offset_check.py --check-schema` and the read-only evidence report pass.

A high score, unique candidate, readable address, or global `confidence` value
cannot substitute for this checklist.

## Handoff requirements

Every completed session handoff must include:

1. session IDs worked;
2. exact result statuses;
3. successes, failures, and partials;
4. what is explicitly ruled out;
5. what must not be repeated without a changed hypothesis;
6. next session ID and timebox;
7. validation commands and results;
8. unrelated local/untracked material left untouched.
